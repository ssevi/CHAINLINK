# CHAINLINK
CHAINLINK SPRING 2023 HACKATHON
Smart contract developers are reinventing applications in finance, gaming, insurance, art, and many more industries, creating a system that executes contracts based on mathematical certainty. Chainlink decentralized oracle networks are at the center of this evolution, enabling developers to leverage high-quality data from APIs and other data sources along with powerful off-chain computation resources to build the next generation of smart contract applications.

Whether you need secure market data for a DeFi app, verifiable randomness for a blockchain-based game, or low-cost off-chain computation to automate various contract functions, Chainlink’s flexible oracle infrastructure provides developers with the extensive suite of decentralized services they need to build more feature-rich dApps.  

This year’s Chainlink Spring 2023 Hackathon aims to empower developers of all skill levels to use Chainlink oracle networks to build decentralized applications that address a wide range of use cases and realize the full potential of hybrid smart contracts. Get hands-on experience with smart contracts, a fast onboarding to the Chainlink tech stack, workshops with top engineers, exposure to blockchain career opportunities, and a chance to win prizes from a total pool of $450k+

Past Chainlink hackathons have seen individuals and teams build hybrid smart contract applications that have redefined what dApps can do. For this event, we want to see even more creative applications that leverage the full power of Chainlink solutions. 

Hackathon participants will have an entire month to explore, experiment, and build together, as well as the opportunity to meet top developers from Chainlink Labs, who will be available to check out their work, offer feedback, and give a behind-the-scenes glimpse of what it’s like to build at the cutting edge of the smart contract industry.

The official hackathon runs from April 28th to June 9th, 2023. See below for more details about the event, including the prizes on offer and potential building opportunities.
